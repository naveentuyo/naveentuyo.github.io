# Usage Guide
When speaking to the bot, all responses containing the wake word will be processed. The user can simply say "<wake_word>, where is Mount Everest?", and the bot will respond. To interupt simply say the hot word while the bot is speaking. If the bot has just replied or interupted, the user does not need to say the wake word for a follow-up prompt. After a couple seconds the bot will sleep, and the wake word will be once again be required.
